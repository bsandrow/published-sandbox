PUBLISHED SANDBOX
-----------------

    I normally keep a ~/sandbox directory where I just work on code that I'm
    programming for fun, and that doesn't necessarily have an end goal in mind
    (or just stuff that I want to stub out/create a frame for before I move it
    into an actual repository). This repository is for code that I think may be
    useful to *someone*, but I'm not planning on creating an actual repository
    for. Basically stuff in ~/sandbox that I feel is good enough, get promoted
    here, and actually published.
